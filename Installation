## Installation

Follow these steps to install and use the URL filtering script:

### Prerequisites

1. **Bash Shell**: This script is designed to run on Linux/Unix systems with a Bash shell. Ensure that you have Bash installed (default on most Linux distributions and macOS).
2. **Basic Tools**: The script uses `grep`, `sed`, and `cat`, which are typically included in most Linux distributions. Verify their availability with:
   ```bash
   which grep sed cat
   ```

### Steps to Install

1. **Download the Script**:
   Save the script file as `filter_urls.sh`. You can create this file manually or download it from your repository.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Use the following command to make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x filter_urls.sh
   ```

3. **Move the Script to a Directory in Your PATH**:
   To use the script globally, move it to a directory included in your system's `PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```bash
   sudo mv filter_urls.sh /usr/local/bin/filter_urls
   ```

   Alternatively, you can execute the script from its current directory using:
   ```bash
   ./filter_urls.sh
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**:
   Ensure the script is installed and accessible:
   ```bash
   filter_urls --help
   ```

### Optional: Install Dependencies (if required)

If any basic tools (`grep`, `sed`, etc.) are missing, install them using your system's package manager:

- **For Debian/Ubuntu**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install grep sed coreutils
  ```

- **For Red Hat/Fedora**:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install grep sed coreutils
  ```

- **For macOS (using Homebrew)**:
  ```bash
  brew install grep gnu-sed
  ```

### Ready to Use

Once installed, you can use the script as described in the [Usage](#usage) section. If you encounter any issues, ensure the script has execute permissions and is in a directory included in your system's `PATH`.
